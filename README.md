A simple Cross platform side scrolling game (much like Mario) made with LibGdx, Box2D and Overlap2D.

# Import in Eclipse
Go to File -> Import -> Gradle -> Gradle Project
Click Browse and navigate to the root folder of project, then click Build Model. 

After a while, you'll see a root project and subprojects (android, core, desktop). Select all the projects and click Finish. 

Note: that this process can take a minute or two the first time you do it, as Gradle and some dependencies will be downloaded in the background.
